I've currently got it hosted on azure although for custom domains, I need to upgrade my subscription. Is there a cheap subscription on Azure to do so? Should I switch to AWS? Alternatively, are there any other cheaper ways to host that I could look at?\n    submitted by    /u/Jaimster08  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is downloadable from the Visual Studio website. \nVisual Studio Code 1.59 includes a preview of automatic language detection of untitled files. This feature uses machine learning to determine which programming language developers are coding in and automatically sets the language mode of the untitled file, drawing on the Tensorflow.js machine learning library and a machine learning model from Guesslang. If the model is not confident enough in its language prediction, then the editor will stay in the current language mode and no results will show in the language picker until language detection has more confidence.

There is concern that concentrating on a single cloud provider’s resources could leave that bank exposed if the cloud provider has a major outage or for some other reasons goes away. Or more likely, jacks up prices to unacceptable levels or changes to draconian terms.\nThere is even concern that regulators won’t be able to access information from some public cloud providers, many of which are hosted in other countries. The concentration of compute and storage resources on platforms not owned and operated by the banks could lead to unacceptable risk to bank customers, investors, and other stakeholders.

Today, Confluent Cloud accounts for 22% of the company’s revenues. More tellingly, growth in that cloud business was up 200%, according to Kreps in Confluent’s first earnings call, outpacing the company’s overall revenue growth in the quarter (64%), and even accelerating beyond Confluent Cloud’s trailing 12-month growth rate of 134%.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

Lately, more people are noticing that the cloud is much more complex than the original sales pitch indicated. If cloud computing is our ultimate destination, we need to deal with this complexity sooner rather than later.\nAdrian Bridgwater, writing for Forbes, nailed the reason cloud computing is so complex: “Cloud is complicated because computing itself is inherently complicated, and the popularization of the cloud model approach has been constitutionally riddled with chaotic platform-level mismatches that have slammed together with incongruent tectonic force.”\nTo read this article in full, please click here",
