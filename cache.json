          "author": null,
          "description": "VR eye tracking is a sensory technology that collects important data about how people interact with visual stimuli. It determines the level of presence, attention, and concentration, as well as some biometric data. This is achieved by continuously measuring the distance between the center of the pupil and the corneal reflection, which varies with the angle of view. This reflection creates infrared light invisible to the human eye. And cameras record and track movements.\n In the real world, the eyes display what is called “vergence”, where the angle of view is directed towards the center point where the gaze meets. In VR, the display is placed so close in front of the eyes that the eyes do not necessarily display vergence, but of course, a sense of depth is retained due to the 3D information presented. And VR technology solves this problem. It creates a model of what the eye is looking at based on data from the virtual environment.\n Tech giants Microsoft, Facebook, Snap, and Magic Leap were the first to see the benefits, and have already gained eye-tracking companies. It is worth giving credit to their foresight because VR eye-tracking technology opens up incredible opportunities for researchers.\n Watch this video to know benefits of eye tracking\n    submitted by    /u/Sasha-Jelvix  \n [link]   [comments]",

This company has terrible records as it currently stands, so we're going to have to reach out to app owners en masse for information that will assist with the migration. \n My first thought is a Microsoft form for these folks to fill out, but there doesn't seem to be dynamic branching (ie: if I input my name as John Smith, the next question will display the apps that are assigned to me for selection rather than user input of the app name/a drop down menu of 800ish apps). \n How do you folks handle mass app inventorying/information gathering?\n    submitted by    /u/Dreadcarrier  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": ".NET 6, the planned upgrade to Microsoft’s software development platform, boasts performance improvements in areas ranging from just-in-time (JiT) compilation and garbage collection (GC) to JSON, according to Microsoft.\nIn a lengthy blog post published August 17, Steven Toub, a developer on the .NET team at Microsoft, surveyed the many performance improvements in .NET 6. Toub noted the JiT has an “unbelievable number” of performance improvements, impacting aspects such as inlining, which is the process by which the compiler takes code from a method callee and emits it into the caller. By exposing the contents of the callee to the context of the caller, inlining enables “knock-on” optimizations that wouldn’t otherwise be possible.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

Augmented and virtual reality (VR) technologies are coming back as the foundation of a new generation of interactive experiences. There’s a lot of work to be done to add these experiences to our applications, and even more work needed to move mixed-reality development away from gaming-derived technologies like Unity.\nHow can we make it simple to build mixed reality and deliver it to as many devices as possible? One answer is to go back to the browser, where many of the early VR experiments began, building mixed reality into browser APIs and working with existing browser 3D technologies like WebGL. That’s where work from web standards bodies is essential, designing APIs that work in all modern browsers and on as many devices as possible.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "Go 1.17, the latest release of the open source, Google-developed programming language, is now available as a production release, with changes intended to simplify coding for safety.\nGo 1.17 was published on August 16. Release notes cite three small enhancements to the language, including two intended to simplify writing code that conforms to unsafe.Pointer’s safety rules. The three enhancements include:\n\nAn expression s of type []T may now be converted to array pointer type *[N]T. If a is the result of such a conversion, then corresponding indices that are in range refer to the same underlying elements: &a[i] == &s[i] for 0 <= i < N. The conversion panics if len(s) is less than N.\nunsafe.Add: unsafe.Add(ptr, len) adds len to ptr and returns the updated pointer unsafe.Pointer(uintptr(ptr) + uintptr(len)).\nunsafe.Slice: For expression ptr of type *T, unsafe.Slice(ptr, len) returns a slice of type []T whose underlying array starts at ptr and whose length and capacity are len.\nFor the compiler, Go 1.17 implements a new way of passing function arguments and results using registers rather than the stack. This is enabled for Linux, MacOS, and Windows on the 64-bit x86 architecture. Benchmarking has shown a resulting performance improvement of about 5% and a typical reduction in binary size of about 2%. This change does not affect the functionality of safe Go code. Also with the compiler, functions containing closures can be inlined. One effect of this is that a function with a closure may produce a distinct closure code pointer function for each place that the function is inlined.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

It is downloadable from the Visual Studio website. \nVisual Studio Code 1.59 includes a preview of automatic language detection of untitled files.

Like many such outages, this one was caused by a relatively small web player, Fastly. Fastly provides cloud services and local caching for major portions of the internet. When it went down, the impact was felt throughout the internet.\nAs your application scales, it also becomes more complex. More scale and more complexity mean higher risk of a problem that could impact availability.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

To date, you’ve moved 15% of the applications and data.\nThis is an impressive feat by any measure. However, the board of directors’ focus is no longer on what’s been accomplished. Now they’ve called you to a meeting to review some of the decisions you made along the way. Because a single cloud provider ended up being the “preferred cloud,” the board wants to know why that provider’s solution was “always the right answer.”\n\n[ Also on InfoWorld: Which multicloud architecture will win out? ]\nHere’s a simple fact: One provider rarely has the best or optimal solution because you can’t leverage best-of-breed features from the other cloud providers’ native systems. Perhaps one has a better artificial intelligence platform, another is better at devops, and a third supports a compliance system that could have saved the company more than $500K last year in fines from failing an audit.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

A v-memo hit lets Vue skip virtual DOM diffing and the creation of new Vnodes altogether.

Lately, more people are noticing that the cloud is much more complex than the original sales pitch indicated. If cloud computing is our ultimate destination, we need to deal with this complexity sooner rather than later.\nAdrian Bridgwater, writing for Forbes, nailed the reason cloud computing is so complex: “Cloud is complicated because computing itself is inherently complicated, and the popularization of the cloud model approach has been constitutionally riddled with chaotic platform-level mismatches that have slammed together with incongruent tectonic force.”\nTo read this article in full, please click here",
