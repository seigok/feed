But sometimes it assumes that I know things I do not know. For example:\n - Do I have to create a project before I can create a bucket?\n - Is it best to create a bucket for each website?\n ​\n The documentation also assumes that I have things I do not have. For example:\n - How do I create the websites to upload?\n - Can I use tools that are available on the console?\n - Or do I need to use third party tools? - If so, which ones?\n ​\n I know this is asking a lot.

Let's review it in detail.\n The first beta version of the Angular CLI was launched in 2017, and since then over 450 versions have been released.\n Although you do not have to necessarily use Angular CLI to develop an Angular application (why wouldn’t you, though?) there is no denying its numerous benefits. For instance, the program contains features that automate redundant tasks and improve the quality of your codes.\n To use Angular CLI, there is a need to integrate it with various tools. Node.js 6.9.0 and npm 3.0.0 or higher are some of the applications you need to install. But, if you have the Node.js and NPM already installed, you can use the command to install Angular CLI with TypeScript from the box.\n    submitted by    /u/Sasha-Jelvix  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Digitalization and technologies are powerful catalysts for changes in every industry, and especially medicine. CPOE stands for computerized provider order entry. The technology represents a computer application that allows doctors to create orders for drugs, laboratory and imaging tests, and other medical services electronically rather than by writing and transmitting paper-based prescriptions.\n A computerized physician order entry system is used in the hospital environment for providing inpatient care.\n The first CPOE system was introduced right back in 1971 in El Camino Hospital, California, by Lockheed Martin Corporation. Back then, it was a revolutionary solution that simplified medication ordering and reduced it to a few clicks.\n However, in its initial years, the technology wasn’t popular. The first reason for it was a very expensive implementation. The second reason was the medical staff’s resistance to adoption due to the poor digital literacy.\n Only in the late 90s, CPOE systems got a second chance for success due to the increased implementation of technologies in the medical area and lower development costs.\n The CPOE solutions bring a lot of advantages to the workflow of the hospital when compared to outdated, paper-based ordering. Let’s check out at the most prominent CPOE benefits indicated both by experts and users:\n -Fewer Medication Errors\n -Increased Efficiency\n -Cost Savings\n In this video, we will better look at the software that has revolutionized the prescription processes and replaced paper-based ordering systems.\n    submitted by    /u/Sasha-Jelvix  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I still like to think \"here's what I would do\".\n Mapping against AWS, I would want to implement the following in order of importance:\n  \nIAM - The hard one\n S3 - Either write your own or implement MinIO?\n EC2 - Lots of Qemu, Bhyve, or Xen at scale\n Databases - Could go either way\n Some sort of docker deployment platform - Prob not too hard\n SNS/SQS - Could go either way too...\n Lambda - This doesn't seem that difficult\n  \nIn addition to the software development associated costs:\n  \nPurchasing IP space\n Configuring hardware\n Writing orchastration systems\n Security - WOW!\n Pipelines\n Networking\n A ton more that I'm not even foreseeing.\n  \nIn the places I looked into they have colocation centers, and you could start small and scale up as needed and have the service provider cover the cooling and purchase/ownership of the IP space.\n I don't have a specific question, just some thoughts.

Here’s the latest.\nKubernetes 1.22, released August 5, 2022, contains the following new and updated features:\n\nServer-side Apply is now generally available. This previously beta-only feature allows objects on Kubernetes servers to be created and modified declaratively, by having the developer describe their intent. Changes to an object are tracked on a field-by-field basis, so that any attempts to change a field modified and “owned” by someone else will be rejected. Server-side Apply is intended eventually to replace the original kubectl apply function because it provides a simpler mechanism for controllers to make changes to their configurations.\nExternal credential providers, available by way of plug-ins, are now out of beta.\nEtcd, the default back-end storage for Kubernetes has been updated to a new release (3.5.0) with bug fixes and new features around log management.\nQoS for memory resources is available as a beta feature. The cgroups v2 API can now be used to designate how memory is allocated and isolated for pods, making it easier to deploy multiple applications that might fight each other for memory usage.\nBetter support for developing and running on Microsoft Windows. Some Kubernetes features for Windows are still alpha—e.g., privileged containers—but it’s now possible to run more of the early-support Kubernetes features on Windows by manually building the Windows kubelet and kube-proxy binaries.\nOther changes in Kubernetes 1.22:\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

The complexity that comes with message passing and thread management results in bugs that can seem non-determinant, with little or no way of spotting precisely what caused a particular interaction. Things get worse when we move away from monolithic apps to distributed microservices running across cloud compute fabrics.\nConcurrent code is inherently complex. Its asynchronous nature ensures that it’s dependent on much more than the various components of your application, affected by the underlying network and the performance of the various services that help support its code.

The reason is that Copilot requires running software that is not free, such as Microsoft’s Visual Studio IDE or Visual Studio Code editor, the FSF contends, and constitutes a “service as a software substitute” meaning it’s a way to gain power over other people’s computing.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",
