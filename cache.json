This improves general performance in code with fairly complex types.\n\n[ Also on InfoWorld: 7 tools transforming JavaScript development ]\nOther performance enhancements in TypeScript 4.4 promise faster path normalization and path mapping, along with faster incremental builds. An optimization has been added for source map generation of very large output files, and faster --force builds are offered as well. A -- force build does not need up-to-date checks to determine which files need to be rebuilt, with project dependencies rebuilt from scratch.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

Confluent is the primary sponsor of the open source project Apache Kafka, and to help it cover the costs of that development, Confluent rolled out a cloud service in 2017. Today, Confluent Cloud accounts for 22% of the company’s revenues. More tellingly, growth in that cloud business was up 200%, according to Kreps in Confluent’s first earnings call, outpacing the company’s overall revenue growth in the quarter (64%), and even accelerating beyond Confluent Cloud’s trailing 12-month growth rate of 134%.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

Now they’ve called you to a meeting to review some of the decisions you made along the way. Because a single cloud provider ended up being the “preferred cloud,” the board wants to know why that provider’s solution was “always the right answer.”\n\n[ Also on InfoWorld: Which multicloud architecture will win out? ]\nHere’s a simple fact: One provider rarely has the best or optimal solution because you can’t leverage best-of-breed features from the other cloud providers’ native systems.

Performance of the template compiler also has been improved, with faster creation of Vnodes (virtual nodes). A new v-memo directive provides the ability to “memoize” part of the template tree.

          "description": "It’s not news that I’ve beat the cloud complexity drum for the past several years. Complexity is rarely an issue when a company first implements a cloud architecture, so many people on staff don’t feel an urgent need to deal with it. Lately, more people are noticing that the cloud is much more complex than the original sales pitch indicated. If cloud computing is our ultimate destination, we need to deal with this complexity sooner rather than later.\nAdrian Bridgwater, writing for Forbes, nailed the reason cloud computing is so complex: “Cloud is complicated because computing itself is inherently complicated, and the popularization of the cloud model approach has been constitutionally riddled with chaotic platform-level mismatches that have slammed together with incongruent tectonic force.”\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

This previously beta-only feature allows objects on Kubernetes servers to be created and modified declaratively, by having the developer describe their intent. Changes to an object are tracked on a field-by-field basis, so that any attempts to change a field modified and “owned” by someone else will be rejected. Server-side Apply is intended eventually to replace the original kubectl apply function because it provides a simpler mechanism for controllers to make changes to their configurations.\nExternal credential providers, available by way of plug-ins, are now out of beta.\nEtcd, the default back-end storage for Kubernetes has been updated to a new release (3.5.0) with bug fixes and new features around log management.\nQoS for memory resources is available as a beta feature. The cgroups v2 API can now be used to designate how memory is allocated and isolated for pods, making it easier to deploy multiple applications that might fight each other for memory usage.\nBetter support for developing and running on Microsoft Windows.
