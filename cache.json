Without specific automated controls and reporting in place, you’re bound to get an eye-widening cloud bill at some point. It’s hardly a new phenomenon. This happens at home with sudden rises in electric or water bills that reflect seasonal usage, or cable TV bills that mean the kids have been binge-watching pay-per-view.

This means that you can take advantage of your logging framework to get infrastructure logs from your logging infrastructure. While this can help you gain deeper insights into your application metrics, this does have its downsides as well. For example, you would often get too many logs, i.e., too many messages in your logs that might not be meaningful.\nSerilog is a third-party, open-source library that integrates nicely with ASP.NET Core and allows developers to easily log-structured event data to the console, to files, and various kinds of log targets. I’ve discussed on the basic features of Serilog in a previous article here.

          "description": "From stock market analysis to economic forecasting, earthquake prediction, and industrial process and quality control, time series analysis has countless applications that enterprises of all kinds rely on to detect trends, develop forecasts, and improve outcomes. In the past year, using time series modeling to manage responses to the pandemic has definitely been one of the most urgent applications of time series analysis.\nTime series analysis involves identifying attributes of your time series data, such as trend and seasonality, by measuring statistical properties such as covariance and autocorrelation. Once the attributes of observed time series data are identified, they can be interpreted, integrated with other data, and used for anomaly detection, forecasting, and other machine learning tasks.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "The sudden acceleration in digital transformation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic revealed how unprepared most businesses were. One of the biggest problems they still face is the “app gap,” the lack of applications that end users need to do their jobs effectively. Low-code and no-code tools go some of the way to filling the gap, with UI builders and robotic process automation, but there’s still a lot to do.\nOne option is to use machine learning to improve developer productivity. We’re already using basic rules-based tools to provide code completion and help expose methods, so why not go further and build on a massive data set of public code to share how common design patterns are applied, what algorithms are used in what contexts, and how developers take advantage of public APIs?\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

This is why PaaS options are often labeled “opinionated” and are best suited for new, greenfield applications.\n\n[ Also on InfoWorld: What is cloud computing?

Sure, they envision the day they will need to expand, and they build growth into their financial plans, but they rarely architect their applications for scalability early on.

As the business grows, scaling becomes a point of concern.\n\n[ Also on InfoWorld: 3 reasons centralizing your data is a bad idea ]\nThe need to scale often becomes evident when a new SaaS service hits a resource capacity limit, specifically data access resource capacity.
