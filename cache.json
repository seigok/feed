Next we moved on to distributed objects and SOA (service-oriented architecture) services where reuse grew out of single applications, and then to reusable services that are loosely coupled and reside on different platforms.

The capability is useful for getting out of loops that have breakpoints.\nPreview 2 is accessible from the Visual Studio website.

Also, Web Live Preview adds tools to make web design more approachable for ASP.NET web designers. Changes can be seen live in the IDE, even with data-bound controls.

This means that you can take advantage of your logging framework to get infrastructure logs from your logging infrastructure. While this can help you gain deeper insights into your application metrics, this does have its downsides as well. For example, you would often get too many logs, i.e., too many messages in your logs that might not be meaningful.\nSerilog is a third-party, open-source library that integrates nicely with ASP.NET Core and allows developers to easily log-structured event data to the console, to files, and various kinds of log targets. I’ve discussed on the basic features of Serilog in a previous article here.
