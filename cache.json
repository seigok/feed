With this, the hardware would only have to fulfill the minimum requirements.\n Have you heard/read about something like this? Is it possible?

It is multithreaded, and can take full advantage of the high core counts I believe are common on cloud machines. My question is, as someone who knows basically nothing about cloud computing, what is the simplest way for me to do this? I have relatively good programming/technical knowledge, and I don't mind doing some learning, and I also don't expect to get this anywhere for free, but I would really appreciate some advice as to what I should be looking for or even just what terms I can use to search for services like this.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Theoluky55  \n [link]   [comments]",

The rest was spent outside the company, working with open source companies such as Confluent and Databricks to improve AWS partnerships with those companies.\nOh, and along the way, I helped put out dumpster fires that erupted when AWS was perceived to be doing “bad things” to open source companies and communities.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

They’ll have a migration tool and procedures to move to other similar services, sometimes to competitors. In some cases, they will pay for consultants to do it for you.\n\n[ Also on InfoWorld: PaaS, CaaS, or FaaS?

Types aren’t associated with the names for things, but with the things themselves.\nThis makes Python flexible and convenient for developers, because you don’t have to rigorously define and track variable types if you’re just throwing together a quick-and-dirty script. But for bigger projects, especially libraries used by third parties, it helps to know which object types are associated with which variables.\n\n[ Tune into Serdar Yegulalp’s Smart Python video tutorials to learn smart Python tricks in 5 minutes or less ]\nFor some time now, Python has had the ability to “annotate” names with type information, in one form or another. With Python 3.5, type hints officially became part of the language (PEP 484). Using a linter or code-checking tool, developers can check the consistency of variables and their types across a code base, and perform static analyses of code that would previously have been difficult or impossible. All this is done ahead of time, before the code runs.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

The underlying mathematics of software drive our programming languages and our algorithms, providing tools and concepts we use to build code.\nCode is complex, a knot of functions that execute in different ways at different times. We can think that it works, we can see that it works, but can we prove that it works?

Release notes cite three small enhancements to the language, including two intended to simplify writing code that conforms to unsafe.Pointer’s safety rules. The three enhancements include:\n\nAn expression s of type []T may now be converted to array pointer type *[N]T. If a is the result of such a conversion, then corresponding indices that are in range refer to the same underlying elements: &a[i] == &s[i] for 0 <= i < N. The conversion panics if len(s) is less than N.\nunsafe.Add: unsafe.Add(ptr, len) adds len to ptr and returns the updated pointer unsafe.Pointer(uintptr(ptr) + uintptr(len)).\nunsafe.Slice: For expression ptr of type *T, unsafe.Slice(ptr, len) returns a slice of type []T whose underlying array starts at ptr and whose length and capacity are len.\nFor the compiler, Go 1.17 implements a new way of passing function arguments and results using registers rather than the stack. This is enabled for Linux, MacOS, and Windows on the 64-bit x86 architecture. Benchmarking has shown a resulting performance improvement of about 5% and a typical reduction in binary size of about 2%. This change does not affect the functionality of safe Go code. Also with the compiler, functions containing closures can be inlined. One effect of this is that a function with a closure may produce a distinct closure code pointer function for each place that the function is inlined.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",
