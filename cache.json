I am certain the majority of this would be a very serious undertaking, taking years to actually implement. But I still like to think \"here's what I would do\".\n Mapping against AWS, I would want to implement the following in order of importance:\n  \nIAM - The hard one\n S3 - Either write your own or implement MinIO?\n EC2 - Lots of Qemu, Bhyve, or Xen at scale\n Databases - Could go either way\n Some sort of docker deployment platform - Prob not too hard\n SNS/SQS - Could go either way too...\n Lambda - This doesn't seem that difficult\n  \nIn addition to the software development associated costs:\n  \nPurchasing IP space\n Configuring hardware\n Writing orchastration systems\n Security - WOW!\n Pipelines\n Networking\n A ton more that I'm not even foreseeing.\n  \nIn the places I looked into they have colocation centers, and you could start small and scale up as needed and have the service provider cover the cooling and purchase/ownership of the IP space.\n I don't have a specific question, just some thoughts.

What I’m asking is closer to P2P topology than “sharing all resources together on a specific private cloud”.\n    submitted by    /u/curcuminx  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So looking for advise on Disaster Recovery models for the cloud. \n In the past Disaster Recovery was pretty straight forward if you can believe that. You could have a simple matrix and use a Tier Level to show the levels of service. For instance, take a Tier structure like the one below. The Tier level starts at the bottom with Tier 1. Tier 1 is backup only. You would then progress to Tier2, then Tier3, then Tier 4 with each Tier level growing in redundancy and cost. \n Tier 1 - Data Backup Only\n Tier 2 - Snapshot replication\n Tier 2 - Warm Site\n Tier 4 - Active/Active - Hot Site\n If you're a managed service provider and you have to create a framework for your customers its not as simple because your customers can ask for more complex backup options. With AWS you might offer Active/Active, pilot light and other backup solutions but what if the customers wants to use Google or Azure. How do you create a framework that takes each Cloud Service Provider and then create different levels of service. I'm currently trying to work on a framework, matrix, what ever you want to call it, but I'm just curious if anyone has seen documentation that compares the different cloud solution dr capabilities and tries to group them into different service groups for their customers. \n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/moss728  \n [link]   [comments]",

The developer writes code in Python using Triton’s libraries, which are then JIT-compiled to run on the GPU. This allows integration with the rest of the Python ecosystem, currently the biggest destination for developing machine learning solutions.

It may not be the flexible, general artificial intelligence promised by science fiction stories, but it’s a powerful alternative to rules engines and brute force image and voice recognition systems. But one big problem remains: Modern AI is composed of black-box systems that are only as good as their training data.\nThe underlying nature of the ML-powered modules we drop into our applications and services raises new questions about how we design our applications. If we don’t know exactly how an application makes decisions, how can we inform its operators and users? We need some way to design that mix of certainty and uncertainty into our code so that we can show users that, while applications make decisions, they need to remain aware of algorithmic bias and other fundamental sources of error.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

Although Python code is almost always fast enough for the task, sometimes it isn’t. In those cases, you need to find out where and why it lags, and do something about it.\nA well-respected adage of software development, and engineering generally, is “Measure, don’t guess.” With software, it’s easy to assume what’s wrong, but never a good idea to do so. Statistics about actual program performance are always your best first tool to making applications faster.\n\n[ Tune into Serdar Yegulalp’s Smart Python video tutorials to learn smart Python tricks in 5 minutes or less ]\nThe good news is, Python offers a whole slew of packages you can use to profile your applications and learn where it’s slowest. These tools range from simple one-liners included with the standard library to sophisticated frameworks for gathering stats from running applications. Here I cover five of the most significant, all of which run cross-platform and are readily available either in PyPI or in Python’s standard library.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

Framed that way, it would be reasonable to assume both creators should make roughly the same, given similar seniority/geography/etc. Reasonable, but incorrect. Software developers may not make the fabled $3 million a year but, on balance, they tend to make a lot more than the folks writing docs that make their code approachable.\nIt’s time that we changed this—and not out of some hazy notion of fairness. No, you’re going to want to pay your docs writers more once you realize just how much value they create and unlock.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

They embrace devops cultures, principles, and automations to improve deployment frequencies, lead time to changes, mean time to resolve incidents, and other key performance indicators (KPIs).\nYou might be wondering how your team and department stacks up against other similar-minded organizations in adopting agile and devops.

This improves general performance in code with fairly complex types.

It layers on higher-order services (like a central store and events). And for good measure, it tosses in full-featured SSR (server-side rendering) and Suspense.\nI talked to Solid’s creator, Ryan Carniato, about how he and the Solid team pulled this off, how Solid relates to industry developments, how innovative front-end features (like partial hydration, streaming SSR, and Suspense) are implemented, and what motivates him to keep pushing the limits of front-end JavaScript performance.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

Despite the potential of time series forecasting to transform business models and improve bottom lines, many companies have yet to adopt its technologies and reap the benefits. Let’s start with a definition, and follow with a brief overview of applications and methods.\nTime series forecasting is a technique for predicting future events by analyzing past trends, based on the assumption that future trends will hold similar to historical trends. Forecasting involves using models fit on historical data to predict future values. Prediction problems that involve a time component require time series forecasting, which provides a data-driven approach to effective and efficient planning.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",
