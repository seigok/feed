One of the biggest problems they still face is the “app gap,” the lack of applications that end users need to do their jobs effectively. Low-code and no-code tools go some of the way to filling the gap, with UI builders and robotic process automation, but there’s still a lot to do.\nOne option is to use machine learning to improve developer productivity. We’re already using basic rules-based tools to provide code completion and help expose methods, so why not go further and build on a massive data set of public code to share how common design patterns are applied, what algorithms are used in what contexts, and how developers take advantage of public APIs?\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

The different types of filters correspond to the various pipeline stages, from authorization to execution of results. In addition to built-in filters for authorization, exception handling, etc., you can also write your own custom filters.\n\n\n[ Keep up with the latest developments in Microsoft .NET, C#, and software development.

But VCs have been pouring money into open source since Red Hat lit the fuse back in 1999 when it went public, with no deceleration since then. What has changed is the kind of open source investment that succeeds. Open source used to succeed by copycatting proprietary software. Now it’s winning by creating whole new categories.

It’s easier for startups and smaller companies to run their businesses with a mix of software as a service (SaaS) with applications and data hosted on one public cloud. Many organizations run on hybrid clouds with applications and data split between private clouds, legacy data center infrastructure, and a selected public cloud.\nBut many medium and larger enterprises choose to run on multiple public clouds or end up in that situation to support innovation, regulations, service levels, pricing negotiations, or acquisitions. There are choices and trade-offs to cloud strategies.

Note that zero trust and SASE are terms defined by Forrester Research and Gartner, respectively, and not by groups of security solutions providers.\nDespite all this security technology, security solutions have become more complex and difficult to operate as cloud deployments themselves become more complex. As the technology and technology concepts (such as SASE) add more big ideas to the problem, the growth of cloud, Internet of Things, edge computing, and now work from anywhere quickly outpaces our ability to provide workable and cost-effective security.

For example, a time series line graph (also called a timeplot) displays values against time. It is similar to x-y graphs but displays only time on the x-axis.
