          "author": null,
          "description": "VR eye tracking is a sensory technology that collects important data about how people interact with visual stimuli. It determines the level of presence, attention, and concentration, as well as some biometric data. This is achieved by continuously measuring the distance between the center of the pupil and the corneal reflection, which varies with the angle of view. This reflection creates infrared light invisible to the human eye. And cameras record and track movements.\n In the real world, the eyes display what is called “vergence”, where the angle of view is directed towards the center point where the gaze meets. In VR, the display is placed so close in front of the eyes that the eyes do not necessarily display vergence, but of course, a sense of depth is retained due to the 3D information presented. And VR technology solves this problem. It creates a model of what the eye is looking at based on data from the virtual environment.\n Tech giants Microsoft, Facebook, Snap, and Magic Leap were the first to see the benefits, and have already gained eye-tracking companies. It is worth giving credit to their foresight because VR eye-tracking technology opens up incredible opportunities for researchers.\n Watch this video to know benefits of eye tracking\n    submitted by    /u/Sasha-Jelvix  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here’s why:\n\n[ Can the cloud save you money? These companies say yes ]\nIf we do an honest assessment of ourselves, most of us in the technology community have a certain arrogance. We’re quick to move on to new technology trends, such as cloud, edge, etc., and we do so with the expectation that others will follow.

Toub noted the JiT has an “unbelievable number” of performance improvements, impacting aspects such as inlining, which is the process by which the compiler takes code from a method callee and emits it into the caller. By exposing the contents of the callee to the context of the caller, inlining enables “knock-on” optimizations that wouldn’t otherwise be possible.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "String interpolation is a technique that enables you to insert expression values into literal strings. It is also known as variable substitution, variable interpolation, or variable expansion. It is a process of evaluating string literals containing one or more placeholders that get replaced by corresponding values.\nString interpolation is supported by many programming languages including Python, Perl, PHP, Ruby, Java, Scala, etc. It was introduced in C# in C# 6. This article talks about how we can work with string interpolation in C#.\n\n[ Also on InfoWorld: Full-stack developer: What it is and how you can become one ]\nTo work with the code examples provided in this article, you should have Visual Studio 2019 installed in your system.

Augmented and virtual reality (VR) technologies are coming back as the foundation of a new generation of interactive experiences. There’s a lot of work to be done to add these experiences to our applications, and even more work needed to move mixed-reality development away from gaming-derived technologies like Unity.\nHow can we make it simple to build mixed reality and deliver it to as many devices as possible? One answer is to go back to the browser, where many of the early VR experiments began, building mixed reality into browser APIs and working with existing browser 3D technologies like WebGL.

          "description": "Go 1.17, the latest release of the open source, Google-developed programming language, is now available as a production release, with changes intended to simplify coding for safety.\nGo 1.17 was published on August 16. Release notes cite three small enhancements to the language, including two intended to simplify writing code that conforms to unsafe.Pointer’s safety rules. The three enhancements include:\n\nAn expression s of type []T may now be converted to array pointer type *[N]T. If a is the result of such a conversion, then corresponding indices that are in range refer to the same underlying elements: &a[i] == &s[i] for 0 <= i < N. The conversion panics if len(s) is less than N.\nunsafe.Add: unsafe.Add(ptr, len) adds len to ptr and returns the updated pointer unsafe.Pointer(uintptr(ptr) + uintptr(len)).\nunsafe.Slice: For expression ptr of type *T, unsafe.Slice(ptr, len) returns a slice of type []T whose underlying array starts at ptr and whose length and capacity are len.\nFor the compiler, Go 1.17 implements a new way of passing function arguments and results using registers rather than the stack. This is enabled for Linux, MacOS, and Windows on the 64-bit x86 architecture. Benchmarking has shown a resulting performance improvement of about 5% and a typical reduction in binary size of about 2%. This change does not affect the functionality of safe Go code. Also with the compiler, functions containing closures can be inlined. One effect of this is that a function with a closure may produce a distinct closure code pointer function for each place that the function is inlined.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "When working in web applications in ASP.NET Core, you might often want to build services that are lightweight — i.e., services that don’t have a template or controller class — for lower resource consumption and improved performance. You can create these lightweight services or APIs in the Startup or the Program class.\nThis article talks about how you can build such lightweight services in ASP.NET Core 6. To work with the code examples provided in this article, you should have Visual Studio 2022 installed in your system. If you don’t already have a copy, you can download Visual Studio 2022 here.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "Writing applications from scratch is a time-consuming process that requires serious development skills, often specialized to the target platform. Low-code development platforms and tools (and sometimes no-code products) often speed up and de-skill the development process, although they have their own learning curves.\nIn general, a low-code development platform offers a drag-and-drop designer, modules, forms, processes, workflows, data models, integrations, and one or more programming languages that you can use within the product. The development platform may emit a specification that an engine can use to create an app, or emit a runnable app. The app may or may not interact with the platform’s back end.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "At first look, the big hyperscale public clouds are much the same; they offer similar services and charge similar prices. But each has its own specialty as a result of its parent company’s history. For Microsoft, it’s a strong focus on hybrid cloud, understanding that there will always be reasons why workloads don’t leave on-premises data centers, due to either data sensitivity or government regulations.\nIt’s a commitment that goes both ways, providing tools for quick migration of data and services, using cloud resources for non-sensitive, unregulated data when what’s on-premises is insufficient, and bringing its Azure management tools to your data center, with either Microsoft’s own hardware in Azure Stack, approved third-party hardware with Azure Stack HCI, or its Azure Arc application management tool.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

Just ask Oracle, which continues to rake in billions in database revenue despite being one of developers’ “most dreaded” databases, according to Stack Overflow’s 2021 survey of 72,517 developers. But let’s not focus on the negative. Just like last year (and 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016), Redis topped the charts as developers’ “most loved” database, followed closely by PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

          "description": "It’s not news that I’ve beat the cloud complexity drum for the past several years. Complexity is rarely an issue when a company first implements a cloud architecture, so many people on staff don’t feel an urgent need to deal with it. Lately, more people are noticing that the cloud is much more complex than the original sales pitch indicated. If cloud computing is our ultimate destination, we need to deal with this complexity sooner rather than later.\nAdrian Bridgwater, writing for Forbes, nailed the reason cloud computing is so complex: “Cloud is complicated because computing itself is inherently complicated, and the popularization of the cloud model approach has been constitutionally riddled with chaotic platform-level mismatches that have slammed together with incongruent tectonic force.”\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

That’s natural—no one has yet developed a “Stripe” or “Twilio” for authorization that solves programmers’ problems.\nFollowing payment processing (Stripe), communications (Twilio), and so many other programmers’ problems that have been carved off and simplified by specialized libraries or services, I believe that authorization, the mechanism for controlling who can do what in a system, will be the next software layer to be unbundled.\nAnd in this post I’m going to tell you why.\n\n[ Also on InfoWorld: No one wants to manage Kubernetes anymore ]\nThe great unbundling\nWhen you build an app, you usually have one specific problem you’re trying to solve. It’s essential to be able to avoid thinking about anything that isn’t core to that problem.

The upgrade emphasizes capabilities such as project analysis and easier management of build system dependencies. \nDownloadable from jetbrains.com, IntelliJ IDEA 2021.2 was released on July 26. The update introduces project-wide analysis for Java projects, a new feature that checks every code change for errors before compilation. However, this feature is limited to the IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate edition.\n\n[ Also on InfoWorld: JDK 16: The new features in Java 17 ]\nIn both the Ultimate and Community editions of the IDE, version 2021.2 also will initiate several actions when a project is being saved including reformatting code and optimizing imports. These actions are grouped in Preferences/Settings > Tools > Actions on Save. And version 2021.2 makes it easier to manage Maven and Gradle dependencies with a Package Search plug-in, which allows developers to find version updates for dependencies.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",
