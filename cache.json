          "description": "IT governance is aimed at improving the overall management of IT and support investment in this area. IT governance helps to avoid corporate disruptions and failures caused by poor corporate governance and the mismatch between business and IT goals.\n So let’s review the purpose of IT Governance in more detail.\n IT governance enables an organization to:\n - Show measurable results in line with short- and long-term business objectives;\n - Adhere to legal and regulatory obligations,\n - Increase confidence in its IT services;\n - Comply with certain requirements and rules of corporate governance or public listing;\n - Align IT costs with business priorities;\n - Help clients achieve the desired results.\n As an example, in 2005, Ford Motor Company spent $400 million on a new IT-based procurement system, which it had to abandon later. This is the result of poor IT governance.\n Watch this video to see how quality IT governance works.\n    submitted by    /u/Sasha-Jelvix  \n [link]   [comments]",

Maybe you don’t have the time; maybe you’re just reading through some comments and have a quick fix; maybe your development PC is an hour away and you need to make a change now. You don’t have to worry about code being left on a random PC if you’ve borrowed a keyboard to fix an urgent bug.

With Python 3.5, type hints officially became part of the language (PEP 484). Using a linter or code-checking tool, developers can check the consistency of variables and their types across a code base, and perform static analyses of code that would previously have been difficult or impossible.
