The guide details information on the role an ethical hacker plays, and skills needed to become an ethical hacker.\n Ethical hackers study and professionally execute hacker attacks, and then present common risks and vulnerabilities and suggestions for improvement.\n Ethical hackers have roles depending on their specific skills or specialization. They are categorized into cybersecurity researchers, penetration testers, and information security analysts.\n To become an ethical hacker, you ideally need to complete the training and earn a CEH certification. But there are other types of certifications and courses, such as the Certified Information Systems Security Specialist (CISSP) or the Certified Registry of Ethical Security Testers (CREST).\n    submitted by    /u/Sasha-Jelvix  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Web crawling and web scraping exist as separate concepts and have their differences. Today, we will see what these differences are and what is a web crawler.\n What is web crawling?\n Web crawling is the process of using tools to read, copy and store the content of the websites for archiving or indexing purposes.\n Basically, it is what search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo do. They use crawling to look through the websites, discover what content they include, and build entries for search engine index.\n What’s web scraping?\n Web scraping is the process of extracting a large amount of specific data from online sources. The extracted data is often further interpreted and parsed by data analysts to make more balanced business decisions.\n Watch this video to know why these two terms do not mean the same.\n    submitted by    /u/Sasha-Jelvix  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the past year, using time series modeling to manage responses to the pandemic has definitely been one of the most urgent applications of time series analysis.\nTime series analysis involves identifying attributes of your time series data, such as trend and seasonality, by measuring statistical properties such as covariance and autocorrelation. Once the attributes of observed time series data are identified, they can be interpreted, integrated with other data, and used for anomaly detection, forecasting, and other machine learning tasks.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

Low-code and no-code tools go some of the way to filling the gap, with UI builders and robotic process automation, but there’s still a lot to do.\nOne option is to use machine learning to improve developer productivity. We’re already using basic rules-based tools to provide code completion and help expose methods, so why not go further and build on a massive data set of public code to share how common design patterns are applied, what algorithms are used in what contexts, and how developers take advantage of public APIs?\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

I’m often taken aback by the lack of dissent in general, specifically when I get pushback for pointing out issues with cloud computing that should be understood by now. \n\n[ Also on InfoWorld: The wrong way to think about cloud computing ]\nSecond, the points made in the article are well thought out and reflect other posts I’ve done over the years on cloud topics such as performance, cost, and lock-in.

One of the preeminent NoSQL solutions is MongoDB, a document-oriented data store. We’ll explore what MongoDB is and how it can handle your application requirements in this article.\nMongoDB: A document data store\nRelational databases store information in strictly regulated tables and columns. MongoDB is a document store, which stores information in collections and documents. The primary difference here is that collections and documents are unstructured, sometimes referred to as schema-less.
