They are categorized into cybersecurity researchers, penetration testers, and information security analysts.\n To become an ethical hacker, you ideally need to complete the training and earn a CEH certification. But there are other types of certifications and courses, such as the Certified Information Systems Security Specialist (CISSP) or the Certified Registry of Ethical Security Testers (CREST).\n    submitted by    /u/Sasha-Jelvix  \n [link]   [comments]",

Today, we will see what these differences are and what is a web crawler.\n What is web crawling?\n Web crawling is the process of using tools to read, copy and store the content of the websites for archiving or indexing purposes.\n Basically, it is what search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo do. They use crawling to look through the websites, discover what content they include, and build entries for search engine index.\n What’s web scraping?\n Web scraping is the process of extracting a large amount of specific data from online sources. The extracted data is often further interpreted and parsed by data analysts to make more balanced business decisions.\n Watch this video to know why these two terms do not mean the same.\n    submitted by    /u/Sasha-Jelvix  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "One of the great features of ASP.NET Core is its built-in support for logging. This means that you can take advantage of your logging framework to get infrastructure logs from your logging infrastructure. While this can help you gain deeper insights into your application metrics, this does have its downsides as well. For example, you would often get too many logs, i.e., too many messages in your logs that might not be meaningful.\nSerilog is a third-party, open-source library that integrates nicely with ASP.NET Core and allows developers to easily log-structured event data to the console, to files, and various kinds of log targets. I’ve discussed on the basic features of Serilog in a previous article here. This article talks about a few advanced capabilities in Serilog such as reducing log verbosity and log message summary and how you can implement them in ASP.NET Core MVC 5.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

In that case, you probably have devops capabilities, including continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), infrastructure as code, and tools to create test data sets to enable a testing environment for this service.

In the past year, using time series modeling to manage responses to the pandemic has definitely been one of the most urgent applications of time series analysis.\nTime series analysis involves identifying attributes of your time series data, such as trend and seasonality, by measuring statistical properties such as covariance and autocorrelation. Once the attributes of observed time series data are identified, they can be interpreted, integrated with other data, and used for anomaly detection, forecasting, and other machine learning tasks.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

One of the biggest problems they still face is the “app gap,” the lack of applications that end users need to do their jobs effectively. Low-code and no-code tools go some of the way to filling the gap, with UI builders and robotic process automation, but there’s still a lot to do.\nOne option is to use machine learning to improve developer productivity. We’re already using basic rules-based tools to provide code completion and help expose methods, so why not go further and build on a massive data set of public code to share how common design patterns are applied, what algorithms are used in what contexts, and how developers take advantage of public APIs?\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "In a study by Devo Technology, a cloud-native logging and security analytics company, as many as 81% of organizations revealed that COVID-19 had accelerated their cloud timelines. “Across these companies, there was a 200% jump in organizations planning to move more than 75% of their apps/workloads to the cloud, with 86% of companies placing cloud options in their decision process for new applications, and more than 40% choosing the cloud as their first option.”\nThe reasons are well known by now. Using the public clouds removes many of the pandemic risks of having your own data center, hardware, network, and software. Many companies not in the cloud experienced problems during quarantine. Without physical access to their equipment, they suffered outages that could not be easily fixed.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "Platform as a service (PaaS) is an enabler for software development where a third-party service provider delivers a platform to customers so they can develop, run, and manage software applications without the need to build and maintain the underlying infrastructure themselves.\nMost platforms as a service include templates or build packs, which provide an opinion as to how certain types of applications should be built, typically around the popular 12-factor methodology. This is why PaaS options are often labeled “opinionated” and are best suited for new, greenfield applications.\n\n[ Also on InfoWorld: What is cloud computing? Everything you need to know now ]\nThe advent of cloud computing opened the door for companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google to pull together the key building blocks required to launch an application into an opinionated platform, with the aim of simplifying many of the trickier and repetitive tasks required to deploy code down to a single command or click of the mouse.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",
