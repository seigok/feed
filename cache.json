          "description": "Web crawling and web scraping exist as separate concepts and have their differences. Today, we will see what these differences are and what is a web crawler.\n What is web crawling?\n Web crawling is the process of using tools to read, copy and store the content of the websites for archiving or indexing purposes.\n Basically, it is what search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo do. They use crawling to look through the websites, discover what content they include, and build entries for search engine index.\n What’s web scraping?\n Web scraping is the process of extracting a large amount of specific data from online sources. The extracted data is often further interpreted and parsed by data analysts to make more balanced business decisions.\n Watch this video to know why these two terms do not mean the same.\n    submitted by    /u/Sasha-Jelvix  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the past year, using time series modeling to manage responses to the pandemic has definitely been one of the most urgent applications of time series analysis.\nTime series analysis involves identifying attributes of your time series data, such as trend and seasonality, by measuring statistical properties such as covariance and autocorrelation. Once the attributes of observed time series data are identified, they can be interpreted, integrated with other data, and used for anomaly detection, forecasting, and other machine learning tasks.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

Low-code and no-code tools go some of the way to filling the gap, with UI builders and robotic process automation, but there’s still a lot to do.\nOne option is to use machine learning to improve developer productivity. We’re already using basic rules-based tools to provide code completion and help expose methods, so why not go further and build on a massive data set of public code to share how common design patterns are applied, what algorithms are used in what contexts, and how developers take advantage of public APIs?\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "NoSQL data stores revolutionized software development by allowing for more flexibility in how data is managed. One of the preeminent NoSQL solutions is MongoDB, a document-oriented data store. We’ll explore what MongoDB is and how it can handle your application requirements in this article.\nMongoDB: A document data store\nRelational databases store information in strictly regulated tables and columns. MongoDB is a document store, which stores information in collections and documents. The primary difference here is that collections and documents are unstructured, sometimes referred to as schema-less. This means the structure of a MongoDB instance (the collections and documents) is not predefined and flexes to accommodate whatever data is put in it.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

Data teams are at the center of the storm because they have to balance all the demands for access, data integrity, security, and proper governance, which entails compliance with policies and regulations. The businesses they serve need information as quickly as possible and have little patience for that precarious balancing act. The data teams have to move fast and smart.\nThey also have to be fortune tellers because they need to build not just the systems for today, but also the platforms for tomorrow.

Other aspects of the launch include a name for Project Reunion, new WinUI 3 controls, and a new set of material UI elements as part of Windows’ Fluent UI model.\nUnder the hood, Windows 11 builds on the same Windows-as-a-service model as Windows 10. Insiders using the Dev branch of builds have already been using much of the underlying Windows 11 code, only without its new chrome.
