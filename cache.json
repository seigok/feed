To date, you’ve moved 15% of the applications and data.\nThis is an impressive feat by any measure. However, the board of directors’ focus is no longer on what’s been accomplished. Now they’ve called you to a meeting to review some of the decisions you made along the way. Because a single cloud provider ended up being the “preferred cloud,” the board wants to know why that provider’s solution was “always the right answer.”\n\n[ Also on InfoWorld: Which multicloud architecture will win out? ]\nHere’s a simple fact: One provider rarely has the best or optimal solution because you can’t leverage best-of-breed features from the other cloud providers’ native systems. Perhaps one has a better artificial intelligence platform, another is better at devops, and a third supports a compliance system that could have saved the company more than $500K last year in fines from failing an audit.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

Complexity is rarely an issue when a company first implements a cloud architecture, so many people on staff don’t feel an urgent need to deal with it. Lately, more people are noticing that the cloud is much more complex than the original sales pitch indicated. If cloud computing is our ultimate destination, we need to deal with this complexity sooner rather than later.\nAdrian Bridgwater, writing for Forbes, nailed the reason cloud computing is so complex: “Cloud is complicated because computing itself is inherently complicated, and the popularization of the cloud model approach has been constitutionally riddled with chaotic platform-level mismatches that have slammed together with incongruent tectonic force.”\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

Today, agile development teams use tools like Jira Software to track epics and releases in burndown charts to answer these questions, review priorities, and consider adding or reducing scope.\nOperations teams have had similar challenges defining, measuring, and managing service-level agreements (SLAs), which are often used to establish a business service’s or application’s target uptime or performance. For example, an SLA might specify that a business service must have four 9s of reliability (99.99%), which means that the application can experience only 52.5 minutes of downtime a year.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

Here’s the latest.\nKubernetes 1.22, released August 5, 2022, contains the following new and updated features:\n\nServer-side Apply is now generally available. This previously beta-only feature allows objects on Kubernetes servers to be created and modified declaratively, by having the developer describe their intent. Changes to an object are tracked on a field-by-field basis, so that any attempts to change a field modified and “owned” by someone else will be rejected. Server-side Apply is intended eventually to replace the original kubectl apply function because it provides a simpler mechanism for controllers to make changes to their configurations.\nExternal credential providers, available by way of plug-ins, are now out of beta.\nEtcd, the default back-end storage for Kubernetes has been updated to a new release (3.5.0) with bug fixes and new features around log management.\nQoS for memory resources is available as a beta feature. The cgroups v2 API can now be used to designate how memory is allocated and isolated for pods, making it easier to deploy multiple applications that might fight each other for memory usage.\nBetter support for developing and running on Microsoft Windows. Some Kubernetes features for Windows are still alpha—e.g., privileged containers—but it’s now possible to run more of the early-support Kubernetes features on Windows by manually building the Windows kubelet and kube-proxy binaries.\nOther changes in Kubernetes 1.22:\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

The complexity that comes with message passing and thread management results in bugs that can seem non-determinant, with little or no way of spotting precisely what caused a particular interaction. Things get worse when we move away from monolithic apps to distributed microservices running across cloud compute fabrics.\nConcurrent code is inherently complex.
