          "description": "Digitalization and technologies are powerful catalysts for changes in every industry, and especially medicine. CPOE stands for computerized provider order entry. The technology represents a computer application that allows doctors to create orders for drugs, laboratory and imaging tests, and other medical services electronically rather than by writing and transmitting paper-based prescriptions.\n A computerized physician order entry system is used in the hospital environment for providing inpatient care.\n The first CPOE system was introduced right back in 1971 in El Camino Hospital, California, by Lockheed Martin Corporation. Back then, it was a revolutionary solution that simplified medication ordering and reduced it to a few clicks.\n However, in its initial years, the technology wasn’t popular. The first reason for it was a very expensive implementation. The second reason was the medical staff’s resistance to adoption due to the poor digital literacy.\n Only in the late 90s, CPOE systems got a second chance for success due to the increased implementation of technologies in the medical area and lower development costs.\n The CPOE solutions bring a lot of advantages to the workflow of the hospital when compared to outdated, paper-based ordering. Let’s check out at the most prominent CPOE benefits indicated both by experts and users:\n -Fewer Medication Errors\n -Increased Efficiency\n -Cost Savings\n In this video, we will better look at the software that has revolutionized the prescription processes and replaced paper-based ordering systems.\n    submitted by    /u/Sasha-Jelvix  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I still like to think \"here's what I would do\".\n Mapping against AWS, I would want to implement the following in order of importance:\n  \nIAM - The hard one\n S3 - Either write your own or implement MinIO?\n EC2 - Lots of Qemu, Bhyve, or Xen at scale\n Databases - Could go either way\n Some sort of docker deployment platform - Prob not too hard\n SNS/SQS - Could go either way too...\n Lambda - This doesn't seem that difficult\n  \nIn addition to the software development associated costs:\n  \nPurchasing IP space\n Configuring hardware\n Writing orchastration systems\n Security - WOW!\n Pipelines\n Networking\n A ton more that I'm not even foreseeing.\n  \nIn the places I looked into they have colocation centers, and you could start small and scale up as needed and have the service provider cover the cooling and purchase/ownership of the IP space.\n I don't have a specific question, just some thoughts.

          "description": "So looking for advise on Disaster Recovery models for the cloud. \n In the past Disaster Recovery was pretty straight forward if you can believe that. You could have a simple matrix and use a Tier Level to show the levels of service. For instance, take a Tier structure like the one below. The Tier level starts at the bottom with Tier 1. Tier 1 is backup only. You would then progress to Tier2, then Tier3, then Tier 4 with each Tier level growing in redundancy and cost. \n Tier 1 - Data Backup Only\n Tier 2 - Snapshot replication\n Tier 2 - Warm Site\n Tier 4 - Active/Active - Hot Site\n If you're a managed service provider and you have to create a framework for your customers its not as simple because your customers can ask for more complex backup options. With AWS you might offer Active/Active, pilot light and other backup solutions but what if the customers wants to use Google or Azure. How do you create a framework that takes each Cloud Service Provider and then create different levels of service. I'm currently trying to work on a framework, matrix, what ever you want to call it, but I'm just curious if anyone has seen documentation that compares the different cloud solution dr capabilities and tries to group them into different service groups for their customers. \n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/moss728  \n [link]   [comments]",

They embrace devops cultures, principles, and automations to increase deployment frequencies, shorten lead time to changes, shorten mean time to resolve incidents, and improve other key performance indicators (KPIs).\nYou might be wondering how your team and department stacks up against other similar-minded organizations in adopting agile and devops. Are you adopting best practices, facing similar struggles, and targeting achievable outcomes?\n\n\n[ Also on InfoWorld: Devops best practices: The 5 methods you should adopt ]\nTwo recently published reports have some answers.

If we don’t know exactly how an application makes decisions, how can we inform its operators and users? We need some way to design that mix of certainty and uncertainty into our code so that we can show users that, while applications make decisions, they need to remain aware of algorithmic bias and other fundamental sources of error.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

Although Python code is almost always fast enough for the task, sometimes it isn’t. In those cases, you need to find out where and why it lags, and do something about it.\nA well-respected adage of software development, and engineering generally, is “Measure, don’t guess.” With software, it’s easy to assume what’s wrong, but never a good idea to do so. Statistics about actual program performance are always your best first tool to making applications faster.\n\n[ Tune into Serdar Yegulalp’s Smart Python video tutorials to learn smart Python tricks in 5 minutes or less ]\nThe good news is, Python offers a whole slew of packages you can use to profile your applications and learn where it’s slowest.

The goal of the fund and the new fellowship is to help developers navigate the requirements of Section 1201 of the DMCA, which makes it illegal to use source code that bypasses measures that control access to copyrighted material.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

This improves general performance in code with fairly complex types. Other performance enhancements in TypeScript 4.4 promise faster path normalization and path mapping, along with faster incremental builds.

Solid is interesting because it takes JSX (React’s templating language) in novel directions. It decorates JSX with a handful of reactive primitives. It is compiled (similar to Svelte). It layers on higher-order services (like a central store and events). And for good measure, it tosses in full-featured SSR (server-side rendering) and Suspense.\nI talked to Solid’s creator, Ryan Carniato, about how he and the Solid team pulled this off, how Solid relates to industry developments, how innovative front-end features (like partial hydration, streaming SSR, and Suspense) are implemented, and what motivates him to keep pushing the limits of front-end JavaScript performance.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

Despite the potential of time series forecasting to transform business models and improve bottom lines, many companies have yet to adopt its technologies and reap the benefits. Let’s start with a definition, and follow with a brief overview of applications and methods.\nTime series forecasting is a technique for predicting future events by analyzing past trends, based on the assumption that future trends will hold similar to historical trends. Forecasting involves using models fit on historical data to predict future values. Prediction problems that involve a time component require time series forecasting, which provides a data-driven approach to effective and efficient planning.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",
