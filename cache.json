          "description": "Python is best thought of as a “dynamic, but strongly typed” language. Types aren’t associated with the names for things, but with the things themselves.\nThis makes Python flexible and convenient for developers, because you don’t have to rigorously define and track variable types if you’re just throwing together a quick-and-dirty script. But for bigger projects, especially libraries used by third parties, it helps to know which object types are associated with which variables.\n\n[ Tune into Serdar Yegulalp’s Smart Python video tutorials to learn smart Python tricks in 5 minutes or less ]\nFor some time now, Python has had the ability to “annotate” names with type information, in one form or another. With Python 3.5, type hints officially became part of the language (PEP 484). Using a linter or code-checking tool, developers can check the consistency of variables and their types across a code base, and perform static analyses of code that would previously have been difficult or impossible. All this is done ahead of time, before the code runs.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

The underlying mathematics of software drive our programming languages and our algorithms, providing tools and concepts we use to build code.\nCode is complex, a knot of functions that execute in different ways at different times. We can think that it works, we can see that it works, but can we prove that it works? It’s possible to use some of the concepts at the heart of functional programming to design languages that produce code that’s mathematically provable, so we can use static analysis techniques to understand how our code will run under various starting conditions.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

Release notes cite three small enhancements to the language, including two intended to simplify writing code that conforms to unsafe.Pointer’s safety rules. The three enhancements include:\n\nAn expression s of type []T may now be converted to array pointer type *[N]T. If a is the result of such a conversion, then corresponding indices that are in range refer to the same underlying elements: &a[i] == &s[i] for 0 <= i < N. The conversion panics if len(s) is less than N.\nunsafe.Add: unsafe.Add(ptr, len) adds len to ptr and returns the updated pointer unsafe.Pointer(uintptr(ptr) + uintptr(len)).\nunsafe.Slice: For expression ptr of type *T, unsafe.Slice(ptr, len) returns a slice of type []T whose underlying array starts at ptr and whose length and capacity are len.\nFor the compiler, Go 1.17 implements a new way of passing function arguments and results using registers rather than the stack. This is enabled for Linux, MacOS, and Windows on the 64-bit x86 architecture. Benchmarking has shown a resulting performance improvement of about 5% and a typical reduction in binary size of about 2%. This change does not affect the functionality of safe Go code. Also with the compiler, functions containing closures can be inlined. One effect of this is that a function with a closure may produce a distinct closure code pointer function for each place that the function is inlined.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "The term “cloud-native computing” has emerged as a catch-all for the various tools and techniques required by software developers to build, deploy, and maintain modern software applications on cloud infrastructure. Here, we define the term, survey the cloud-native landscape, and identify some of the advantages and pitfalls of going cloud-native.\n\n[ Also on InfoWorld: How to choose a cloud database ]\nCloud-native definition\nCloud-native is a modern approach to building and running software applications that exploits the flexibility, scalability, and resilience of cloud computing. Cloud-native encompasses the various tools and techniques used by software developers today to build applications for the public cloud, as opposed to traditional architectures suited to an on-premises data center.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "Microsoft’s TypeScript 4.4, the latest planned version of its popular typed version of JavaScript, has moved to a release candidate stage, with capabilities including performance improvements and control flow analysis.\nNo further changes are expected in the release apart from critical bug fixes.\nFor faster declaration emits, TypeScript now caches whether internal symbols are accessible in different contexts, along with how specific types are to be printed. This improves general performance in code with fairly complex types.\n\n[ Also on InfoWorld: 7 tools transforming JavaScript development ]\nOther performance enhancements in TypeScript 4.4 promise faster path normalization and path mapping, along with faster incremental builds. An optimization has been added for source map generation of very large output files, and faster --force builds are offered as well. A -- force build does not need up-to-date checks to determine which files need to be rebuilt, with project dependencies rebuilt from scratch.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "The “open source business model” has been obvious for some time: It’s called cloud. But obvious in theory doesn’t mean it’s easy to pull off in practice. As software luminary Tim Bray once said, “The qualities that make people great at carving high-value [open source] software out of nothingness aren’t necessarily the ones that make them good at operations.” He’s correct, but it’s also true that during the past few years open source companies have become exceptionally good at cloud operations.\nJust ask Confluent CEO Jay Kreps.\n\n[ Also on InfoWorld: How to choose a cloud database ]\n‘Unlocking’ customers with cloud\nConfluent went public earlier this year on the promise of harnessing data in motion, or streaming data. Confluent is the primary sponsor of the open source project Apache Kafka, and to help it cover the costs of that development, Confluent rolled out a cloud service in 2017. Today, Confluent Cloud accounts for 22% of the company’s revenues. More tellingly, growth in that cloud business was up 200%, according to Kreps in Confluent’s first earnings call, outpacing the company’s overall revenue growth in the quarter (64%), and even accelerating beyond Confluent Cloud’s trailing 12-month growth rate of 134%.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

Like many such outages, this one was caused by a relatively small web player, Fastly. Fastly provides cloud services and local caching for major portions of the internet. When it went down, the impact was felt throughout the internet.\nAs your application scales, it also becomes more complex.

Two beta releases, published on August 4 and August 11 and accessible on GitHub, introduce changes to forms and the router.\nFor forms, Angular 13 debuts a new type, FormControlStatus, which is a union of all possible status strings for form controls. Also, AbstractControl.status has been narrowed from string to FormControlStatus and StatusChanges have been narrowed from Observable<any> to Observable<FormControlStatus>. Most applications should consume these new types seamlessly, according the Angular changelog.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "As the person heading “the cloud project,” you spent the past few years, during the pandemic and before, working to migrate most of the traditional on-premises applications to the public cloud. To date, you’ve moved 15% of the applications and data.\nThis is an impressive feat by any measure. However, the board of directors’ focus is no longer on what’s been accomplished. Now they’ve called you to a meeting to review some of the decisions you made along the way. Because a single cloud provider ended up being the “preferred cloud,” the board wants to know why that provider’s solution was “always the right answer.”\n\n[ Also on InfoWorld: Which multicloud architecture will win out? ]\nHere’s a simple fact: One provider rarely has the best or optimal solution because you can’t leverage best-of-breed features from the other cloud providers’ native systems. Perhaps one has a better artificial intelligence platform, another is better at devops, and a third supports a compliance system that could have saved the company more than $500K last year in fines from failing an audit.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",
