          "description": "VR eye tracking is a sensory technology that collects important data about how people interact with visual stimuli. It determines the level of presence, attention, and concentration, as well as some biometric data. This is achieved by continuously measuring the distance between the center of the pupil and the corneal reflection, which varies with the angle of view. This reflection creates infrared light invisible to the human eye. And cameras record and track movements.\n In the real world, the eyes display what is called “vergence”, where the angle of view is directed towards the center point where the gaze meets. In VR, the display is placed so close in front of the eyes that the eyes do not necessarily display vergence, but of course, a sense of depth is retained due to the 3D information presented. And VR technology solves this problem. It creates a model of what the eye is looking at based on data from the virtual environment.\n Tech giants Microsoft, Facebook, Snap, and Magic Leap were the first to see the benefits, and have already gained eye-tracking companies. It is worth giving credit to their foresight because VR eye-tracking technology opens up incredible opportunities for researchers.\n Watch this video to know benefits of eye tracking\n    submitted by    /u/Sasha-Jelvix  \n [link]   [comments]",

Toub noted the JiT has an “unbelievable number” of performance improvements, impacting aspects such as inlining, which is the process by which the compiler takes code from a method callee and emits it into the caller. By exposing the contents of the callee to the context of the caller, inlining enables “knock-on” optimizations that wouldn’t otherwise be possible.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

Augmented and virtual reality (VR) technologies are coming back as the foundation of a new generation of interactive experiences. There’s a lot of work to be done to add these experiences to our applications, and even more work needed to move mixed-reality development away from gaming-derived technologies like Unity.\nHow can we make it simple to build mixed reality and deliver it to as many devices as possible? One answer is to go back to the browser, where many of the early VR experiments began, building mixed reality into browser APIs and working with existing browser 3D technologies like WebGL.

          "description": "Go 1.17, the latest release of the open source, Google-developed programming language, is now available as a production release, with changes intended to simplify coding for safety.\nGo 1.17 was published on August 16. Release notes cite three small enhancements to the language, including two intended to simplify writing code that conforms to unsafe.Pointer’s safety rules. The three enhancements include:\n\nAn expression s of type []T may now be converted to array pointer type *[N]T. If a is the result of such a conversion, then corresponding indices that are in range refer to the same underlying elements: &a[i] == &s[i] for 0 <= i < N. The conversion panics if len(s) is less than N.\nunsafe.Add: unsafe.Add(ptr, len) adds len to ptr and returns the updated pointer unsafe.Pointer(uintptr(ptr) + uintptr(len)).\nunsafe.Slice: For expression ptr of type *T, unsafe.Slice(ptr, len) returns a slice of type []T whose underlying array starts at ptr and whose length and capacity are len.\nFor the compiler, Go 1.17 implements a new way of passing function arguments and results using registers rather than the stack. This is enabled for Linux, MacOS, and Windows on the 64-bit x86 architecture. Benchmarking has shown a resulting performance improvement of about 5% and a typical reduction in binary size of about 2%. This change does not affect the functionality of safe Go code. Also with the compiler, functions containing closures can be inlined. One effect of this is that a function with a closure may produce a distinct closure code pointer function for each place that the function is inlined.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

It is downloadable from the Visual Studio website. \nVisual Studio Code 1.59 includes a preview of automatic language detection of untitled files.

If the model is not confident enough in its language prediction, then the editor will stay in the current language mode and no results will show in the language picker until language detection has more confidence.

This improves general performance in code with fairly complex types.\n\n[ Also on InfoWorld: 7 tools transforming JavaScript development ]\nOther performance enhancements in TypeScript 4.4 promise faster path normalization and path mapping, along with faster incremental builds. An optimization has been added for source map generation of very large output files, and faster --force builds are offered as well.
