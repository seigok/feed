There the computing tasks (e.g. from software) should be redirected by a Hypervisor straight to a data center, calculated there, and then the solution is sent back. With this, the hardware would only have to fulfill the minimum requirements.\n Have you heard/read about something like this? Is it possible? Especially to make the computing tasks small enough so they can be transferred via the internet.\n Do have any special application of this in mind?\n    submitted by    /u/Ansiiiii  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is multithreaded, and can take full advantage of the high core counts I believe are common on cloud machines. My question is, as someone who knows basically nothing about cloud computing, what is the simplest way for me to do this? I have relatively good programming/technical knowledge, and I don't mind doing some learning, and I also don't expect to get this anywhere for free, but I would really appreciate some advice as to what I should be looking for or even just what terms I can use to search for services like this.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Theoluky55  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Over the years I’ve had a few friends and clients reach out to me, unhappy about some public cloud services being removed, either from a name-brand cloud provider or secondary players. At times, entire clouds were being shut down.\nThe cloud providers typically give plenty of notice (sometimes years), calling the service “legacy” or “classic” for a time. They’ll have a migration tool and procedures to move to other similar services, sometimes to competitors. In some cases, they will pay for consultants to do it for you.\n\n[ Also on InfoWorld: PaaS, CaaS, or FaaS? How to choose ]\nAs a tech CTO for many years, I also had to sunset parts or all of technologies we sold. This meant removing support and eventually making the technology no longer viable for the customer. Again, this was done with plenty of notice, providing migration tools and even funding to make the move to more modern and likely better solutions.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

Types aren’t associated with the names for things, but with the things themselves.\nThis makes Python flexible and convenient for developers, because you don’t have to rigorously define and track variable types if you’re just throwing together a quick-and-dirty script. But for bigger projects, especially libraries used by third parties, it helps to know which object types are associated with which variables.\n\n[ Tune into Serdar Yegulalp’s Smart Python video tutorials to learn smart Python tricks in 5 minutes or less ]\nFor some time now, Python has had the ability to “annotate” names with type information, in one form or another. With Python 3.5, type hints officially became part of the language (PEP 484). Using a linter or code-checking tool, developers can check the consistency of variables and their types across a code base, and perform static analyses of code that would previously have been difficult or impossible. All this is done ahead of time, before the code runs.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

Release notes cite three small enhancements to the language, including two intended to simplify writing code that conforms to unsafe.Pointer’s safety rules. The three enhancements include:\n\nAn expression s of type []T may now be converted to array pointer type *[N]T. If a is the result of such a conversion, then corresponding indices that are in range refer to the same underlying elements: &a[i] == &s[i] for 0 <= i < N. The conversion panics if len(s) is less than N.\nunsafe.Add: unsafe.Add(ptr, len) adds len to ptr and returns the updated pointer unsafe.Pointer(uintptr(ptr) + uintptr(len)).\nunsafe.Slice: For expression ptr of type *T, unsafe.Slice(ptr, len) returns a slice of type []T whose underlying array starts at ptr and whose length and capacity are len.\nFor the compiler, Go 1.17 implements a new way of passing function arguments and results using registers rather than the stack. This is enabled for Linux, MacOS, and Windows on the 64-bit x86 architecture. Benchmarking has shown a resulting performance improvement of about 5% and a typical reduction in binary size of about 2%. This change does not affect the functionality of safe Go code. Also with the compiler, functions containing closures can be inlined. One effect of this is that a function with a closure may produce a distinct closure code pointer function for each place that the function is inlined.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "Visual Studio Code 1.59, the latest version of the popular code editor from Microsoft, has a list of improvements ranging from machine learning-based language detection to a debug Disassembly view.\nAlso called the July 2021 edition, Visual Studio Code 1.59 was published on August 5. It is downloadable from the Visual Studio website. \nVisual Studio Code 1.59 includes a preview of automatic language detection of untitled files. This feature uses machine learning to determine which programming language developers are coding in and automatically sets the language mode of the untitled file, drawing on the Tensorflow.js machine learning library and a machine learning model from Guesslang. If the model is not confident enough in its language prediction, then the editor will stay in the current language mode and no results will show in the language picker until language detection has more confidence. The feature is off by default in the current release.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "Recently the banking industry has faced questions about its use of cloud computing. There is concern that concentrating on a single cloud provider’s resources could leave that bank exposed if the cloud provider has a major outage or for some other reasons goes away. Or more likely, jacks up prices to unacceptable levels or changes to draconian terms.\nThere is even concern that regulators won’t be able to access information from some public cloud providers, many of which are hosted in other countries. The concentration of compute and storage resources on platforms not owned and operated by the banks could lead to unacceptable risk to bank customers, investors, and other stakeholders. There are many dimensions to these risks.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "Robotic process automation (RPA) companies are endeavoring to deliver “the fully automated enterprise,” but even that promise may be shortsighted. Current trends are indicating that there’s much more that can be done with RPA—especially when combined with data science.\nRPA tools started by getting computers to do the repetitive part of what humans do. The “robot” label here is key; it’s a metaphor that indicates that the software is not contained in one system but rather is connected with all (or many) of the information systems that a human worker touches.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "The term “cloud-native computing” has emerged as a catch-all for the various tools and techniques required by software developers to build, deploy, and maintain modern software applications on cloud infrastructure. Here, we define the term, survey the cloud-native landscape, and identify some of the advantages and pitfalls of going cloud-native.\n\n[ Also on InfoWorld: How to choose a cloud database ]\nCloud-native definition\nCloud-native is a modern approach to building and running software applications that exploits the flexibility, scalability, and resilience of cloud computing. Cloud-native encompasses the various tools and techniques used by software developers today to build applications for the public cloud, as opposed to traditional architectures suited to an on-premises data center.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "Microsoft’s TypeScript 4.4, the latest planned version of its popular typed version of JavaScript, has moved to a release candidate stage, with capabilities including performance improvements and control flow analysis.\nNo further changes are expected in the release apart from critical bug fixes.\nFor faster declaration emits, TypeScript now caches whether internal symbols are accessible in different contexts, along with how specific types are to be printed. This improves general performance in code with fairly complex types.\n\n[ Also on InfoWorld: 7 tools transforming JavaScript development ]\nOther performance enhancements in TypeScript 4.4 promise faster path normalization and path mapping, along with faster incremental builds. An optimization has been added for source map generation of very large output files, and faster --force builds are offered as well. A -- force build does not need up-to-date checks to determine which files need to be rebuilt, with project dependencies rebuilt from scratch.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",
