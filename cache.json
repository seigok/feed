          "description": "Digitalization and technologies are powerful catalysts for changes in every industry, and especially medicine. CPOE stands for computerized provider order entry. The technology represents a computer application that allows doctors to create orders for drugs, laboratory and imaging tests, and other medical services electronically rather than by writing and transmitting paper-based prescriptions.\n A computerized physician order entry system is used in the hospital environment for providing inpatient care.\n The first CPOE system was introduced right back in 1971 in El Camino Hospital, California, by Lockheed Martin Corporation. Back then, it was a revolutionary solution that simplified medication ordering and reduced it to a few clicks.\n However, in its initial years, the technology wasn’t popular. The first reason for it was a very expensive implementation. The second reason was the medical staff’s resistance to adoption due to the poor digital literacy.\n Only in the late 90s, CPOE systems got a second chance for success due to the increased implementation of technologies in the medical area and lower development costs.\n The CPOE solutions bring a lot of advantages to the workflow of the hospital when compared to outdated, paper-based ordering. Let’s check out at the most prominent CPOE benefits indicated both by experts and users:\n -Fewer Medication Errors\n -Increased Efficiency\n -Cost Savings\n In this video, we will better look at the software that has revolutionized the prescription processes and replaced paper-based ordering systems.\n    submitted by    /u/Sasha-Jelvix  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So looking for advise on Disaster Recovery models for the cloud. \n In the past Disaster Recovery was pretty straight forward if you can believe that. You could have a simple matrix and use a Tier Level to show the levels of service. For instance, take a Tier structure like the one below. The Tier level starts at the bottom with Tier 1. Tier 1 is backup only. You would then progress to Tier2, then Tier3, then Tier 4 with each Tier level growing in redundancy and cost. \n Tier 1 - Data Backup Only\n Tier 2 - Snapshot replication\n Tier 2 - Warm Site\n Tier 4 - Active/Active - Hot Site\n If you're a managed service provider and you have to create a framework for your customers its not as simple because your customers can ask for more complex backup options. With AWS you might offer Active/Active, pilot light and other backup solutions but what if the customers wants to use Google or Azure. How do you create a framework that takes each Cloud Service Provider and then create different levels of service. I'm currently trying to work on a framework, matrix, what ever you want to call it, but I'm just curious if anyone has seen documentation that compares the different cloud solution dr capabilities and tries to group them into different service groups for their customers. \n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/moss728  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Of the three pillars of observability, traces have historically lagged behind logs and metrics in usage. We’re hoping to change that with Grafana Tempo, an easy-to-operate, high-scale, and cost-effective distributed tracing back end.\nTempo allows users to scale tracing as far as possible with less operational cost and complexity than ever before. Tempo’s only dependency is object storage, and it supports search solely via trace ID. Unlike other tracing back ends, Tempo can hit massive scale without a difficult-to-manage Elasticsearch or Cassandra cluster.\nWe launched this open source project in October 2020, and just seven months later, we’re excited to announce that Tempo has reached GA with v1.0.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

It may not be the flexible, general artificial intelligence promised by science fiction stories, but it’s a powerful alternative to rules engines and brute force image and voice recognition systems. But one big problem remains: Modern AI is composed of black-box systems that are only as good as their training data.\nThe underlying nature of the ML-powered modules we drop into our applications and services raises new questions about how we design our applications. If we don’t know exactly how an application makes decisions, how can we inform its operators and users? We need some way to design that mix of certainty and uncertainty into our code so that we can show users that, while applications make decisions, they need to remain aware of algorithmic bias and other fundamental sources of error.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

Although Python code is almost always fast enough for the task, sometimes it isn’t. In those cases, you need to find out where and why it lags, and do something about it.\nA well-respected adage of software development, and engineering generally, is “Measure, don’t guess.” With software, it’s easy to assume what’s wrong, but never a good idea to do so. Statistics about actual program performance are always your best first tool to making applications faster.\n\n[ Tune into Serdar Yegulalp’s Smart Python video tutorials to learn smart Python tricks in 5 minutes or less ]\nThe good news is, Python offers a whole slew of packages you can use to profile your applications and learn where it’s slowest. These tools range from simple one-liners included with the standard library to sophisticated frameworks for gathering stats from running applications.

Let’s start with a definition, and follow with a brief overview of applications and methods.\nTime series forecasting is a technique for predicting future events by analyzing past trends, based on the assumption that future trends will hold similar to historical trends.
