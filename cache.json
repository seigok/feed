          "description": "IT governance is aimed at improving the overall management of IT and support investment in this area. IT governance helps to avoid corporate disruptions and failures caused by poor corporate governance and the mismatch between business and IT goals.\n So let’s review the purpose of IT Governance in more detail.\n IT governance enables an organization to:\n - Show measurable results in line with short- and long-term business objectives;\n - Adhere to legal and regulatory obligations,\n - Increase confidence in its IT services;\n - Comply with certain requirements and rules of corporate governance or public listing;\n - Align IT costs with business priorities;\n - Help clients achieve the desired results.\n As an example, in 2005, Ford Motor Company spent $400 million on a new IT-based procurement system, which it had to abandon later. This is the result of poor IT governance.\n Watch this video to see how quality IT governance works.\n    submitted by    /u/Sasha-Jelvix  \n [link]   [comments]",

Maybe you don’t have the time; maybe you’re just reading through some comments and have a quick fix; maybe your development PC is an hour away and you need to make a change now. You don’t have to worry about code being left on a random PC if you’ve borrowed a keyboard to fix an urgent bug.

          "description": "SvelteKit is the successor to Sapper, the full-stack, server-side prerendering application framework for Svelte, similar to Next.js for React.\nSvelteKit bears many similarities to Sapper, but adds some new and ambitious features. In particular, SvelteKit allows for targeting different production environments, including serverless environments. SvelteKit also adopts Vite as its dev-time tool, which leverages ES Modules for fast, fine-grained HMR (hot module replacement) during development.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

At the same time, WebAssembly provides a portable compilation target for C/C++, C#, Rust, Go, Kotlin, Swift, and other programming languages.\n\n[ Also on InfoWorld: 7 tools transforming JavaScript development ]\nHailed as a way to both improve web application performance and allow languages other than JavaScript to be used in the development of browser apps, WebAssembly is championed by Google, Mozilla, Apple, and Microsoft, all of which support the technology in their browser engines.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "Python is best thought of as a “dynamic, but strongly typed” language. Types aren’t associated with the names for things, but with the things themselves.\nThis makes Python flexible and convenient for developers, because you don’t have to rigorously define and track variable types if you’re just throwing together a quick-and-dirty script. But for bigger projects, especially libraries used by third parties, it helps to know which object types are associated with which variables.\n\n[ Tune into Serdar Yegulalp’s Smart Python video tutorials to learn smart Python tricks in 5 minutes or less ]\nFor some time now, Python has had the ability to “annotate” names with type information, in one form or another. With Python 3.5, type hints officially became part of the language (PEP 484). Using a linter or code-checking tool, developers can check the consistency of variables and their types across a code base, and perform static analyses of code that would previously have been difficult or impossible. All this is done ahead of time, before the code runs.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

We can think that it works, we can see that it works, but can we prove that it works?
