          "description": "You’ve put a lot of time and effort into tracking, allocating, and reporting on cloud costs, but looking at cloud costs in a vacuum won’t help you achieve your business goals. To be truly efficient, you need to consider the trade-offs between cost, performance/reliability, and the time and effort needed to tune and optimize your applications.\n For cloud-native apps running on Kubernetes, this can be a real challenge. Resources are assigned at a granular level, and those resource decisions are being made in an increasingly distributed manner by engineers who can only guess at the best configuration.\n In this webinar, we’ll show how to broaden your aperture and think about optimization holistically in order to drive business outcomes. \n This Webinar is Best for:\n • FinOps professionals, Cloud Analysts, and Cloud Center of Excellence teams who are struggling to empower engineering teams to make smart resource decisions for their applications running on Kubernetes.\n • SRE and DevOps teams who want to proactively optimize their Kubernetes applications to avoid surprises once apps reach scale in production. \n What You'll Learn:\n • How to manage the trade-offs between competing business goals for cost, performance, and time/effort.\n • Why automation and machine learning are key to effective resource management in a containerized, cloud-native world.\n • How to enable your engineers to make intelligent resource decisions without spending hours on ineffective, trial-and-error application tuning. \n Featured Speakers:\n • Rich Bentley, Senior Director of Product Marketing @ StormForge.io\n • Erwin Daria, Principal Sales Engineer @ StormForge.io\n ​\n Register here to save your seat: [Live Webinar] Beyond Cloud Cost Management: Optimizing Kubernetes for Cost, Performance, and Productivity\n Thursday, July 29 | 12pm EDT (9am PDT)\n On-Demand video will be available one day after event.\n    submitted by    /u/stormforgeio  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Looking for a few options for replatforming a portfolio of applications from Oracle WebLogic into one of the big 2 CSPs. I'd love to go PaaS, but thus far I'm seeing the bets being AVMs on Azure using WLS. The literature makes it seem pretty straight forward. I haven't yet looked into options for AWS. \n \"they\" are also leaning towards OCI... which I'm considering for their OBIEE being replaced with their SaaS offer. Microsoft and Oracle also claim that running the AVMs for WebLogic in Azure and having the Oracle DBs and EDW living in Oracle Cloud is... sound? \n I'm always hesitant to move Oracle DBs to non-OCI because of licensing hurdles, but I'm also looking into how complex it would be to try and convert those into an RDS or Azure SQL/PosgreSQL. \n Just looking for any experience one can share.

          "description": "Industries from energy and retail to transportation and finance today rely on time series forecasting for projecting product demand, resource allocation, financial performance,  predictive maintenance, and countless other applications. Despite the potential of time series forecasting to transform business models and improve bottom lines, many companies have yet to adopt its technologies and reap the benefits. Let’s start with a definition, and follow with a brief overview of applications and methods.\nTime series forecasting is a technique for predicting future events by analyzing past trends, based on the assumption that future trends will hold similar to historical trends. Forecasting involves using models fit on historical data to predict future values. Prediction problems that involve a time component require time series forecasting, which provides a data-driven approach to effective and efficient planning.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "Devops takes the overhead view encompassing the activity of both development and operations, and choreographs them to interact in the most effective ways. That is the conceptual ideal, but from a technical standpoint, can we describe the ideal devops setup?\nThe answer is no, because the demands of a two-person startup are radically different from those of a multi-national embarking on a microservice project with hundreds of people involved in its care and feeding.\nBut we can describe an idealized flow of development that flexes to absorb increasing complexity as needed, and how the technologies, like CI/CD, Docker, and cloud computing, fit into this flow.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "Much of modern operating system functionality happens in and around the kernel. That’s a problem when you’re implementing monitoring and observability tools or adding low-level security tools because hooking into kernel functions is complex. Even Linux, readily accessible and with its system of run-time-loaded kernel modules and modifiable source code, makes it hard.\nOnce you started rolling your own kernel-level tools, you’d quickly end up with a nearly unmaintainable stack of modules and a kernel that only worked for your application. Then there's the problem of upgrading: Would your modifications work with a new kernel release, or would you have to build everything from scratch again, or worse still, would it force you to prevent any updates at all?\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "One of the great features of ASP.NET Core is its built-in support for logging. This means that you can take advantage of your logging framework to get infrastructure logs from your logging infrastructure. While this can help you gain deeper insights into your application metrics, this does have its downsides as well. For example, you would often get too many logs, i.e., too many messages in your logs that might not be meaningful.\nSerilog is a third-party, open-source library that integrates nicely with ASP.NET Core and allows developers to easily log-structured event data to the console, to files, and various kinds of log targets. I’ve discussed on the basic features of Serilog in a previous article here. This article talks about a few advanced capabilities in Serilog such as reducing log verbosity and log message summary and how you can implement them in ASP.NET Core MVC 5.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

In that case, you probably have devops capabilities, including continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), infrastructure as code, and tools to create test data sets to enable a testing environment for this service.
