Basically, I am not using my laptop to the fullest. So, I was really thinking about a possibility for the future. Maybe, you could have a basic laptop(should not cost more than 100$) and with that, you connect with really great hardware and do all your work.\n Do you think this would be possible? In many developing/under-developed countries, Laptops/Computers are still a privilege, and most can't afford them, so why not have simple hardware and a good network? Which allows me to remotely access hardware centers around the world.\n Experts in the field please let me know if this could be possible!\n    submitted by    /u/Ok-Vermicelli9298  \n [link]   [comments]",

To be truly efficient, you need to consider the trade-offs between cost, performance/reliability, and the time and effort needed to tune and optimize your applications.\n For cloud-native apps running on Kubernetes, this can be a real challenge. Resources are assigned at a granular level, and those resource decisions are being made in an increasingly distributed manner by engineers who can only guess at the best configuration.\n In this webinar, we’ll show how to broaden your aperture and think about optimization holistically in order to drive business outcomes. \n This Webinar is Best for:\n • FinOps professionals, Cloud Analysts, and Cloud Center of Excellence teams who are struggling to empower engineering teams to make smart resource decisions for their applications running on Kubernetes.\n • SRE and DevOps teams who want to proactively optimize their Kubernetes applications to avoid surprises once apps reach scale in production. \n What You'll Learn:\n • How to manage the trade-offs between competing business goals for cost, performance, and time/effort.\n • Why automation and machine learning are key to effective resource management in a containerized, cloud-native world.\n • How to enable your engineers to make intelligent resource decisions without spending hours on ineffective, trial-and-error application tuning. \n Featured Speakers:\n • Rich Bentley, Senior Director of Product Marketing @ StormForge.io\n • Erwin Daria, Principal Sales Engineer @ StormForge.io\n ​\n Register here to save your seat: [Live Webinar] Beyond Cloud Cost Management: Optimizing Kubernetes for Cost, Performance, and Productivity\n Thursday, July 29 | 12pm EDT (9am PDT)\n On-Demand video will be available one day after event.\n    submitted by    /u/stormforgeio  \n [link]   [comments]",

This improves general performance in code with fairly complex types.

Solid is interesting because it takes JSX (React’s templating language) in novel directions. It decorates JSX with a handful of reactive primitives. It is compiled (similar to Svelte). It layers on higher-order services (like a central store and events). And for good measure, it tosses in full-featured SSR (server-side rendering) and Suspense.\nI talked to Solid’s creator, Ryan Carniato, about how he and the Solid team pulled this off, how Solid relates to industry developments, how innovative front-end features (like partial hydration, streaming SSR, and Suspense) are implemented, and what motivates him to keep pushing the limits of front-end JavaScript performance.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "Industries from energy and retail to transportation and finance today rely on time series forecasting for projecting product demand, resource allocation, financial performance,  predictive maintenance, and countless other applications. Despite the potential of time series forecasting to transform business models and improve bottom lines, many companies have yet to adopt its technologies and reap the benefits. Let’s start with a definition, and follow with a brief overview of applications and methods.\nTime series forecasting is a technique for predicting future events by analyzing past trends, based on the assumption that future trends will hold similar to historical trends. Forecasting involves using models fit on historical data to predict future values. Prediction problems that involve a time component require time series forecasting, which provides a data-driven approach to effective and efficient planning.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",
